how to make a runner coin:
- have integrity as dev 
- control large supply 
- motivate the community to hold
- make funny/viral/attention grabing meme
- profit


Of course. We don’t just need more coins - we need more coins with the right holders, ones who don’t sell at +30% profit. A good narrative alone isn’t enough. In the end, charts are moved by people.



I see so many tweets saying that supply control is the main reason $WHITEWHALE succeeded.

Bro, this guy does ultra high quality market making, runs $250K prize pool holding giveaways, publishes treasury reports, communicates with holders 24/7 in the chat, produces super engaging content, does OTC buys to avoid harming the chart, and sleeps two hours a day. I can go on and on.

This is not a supply control thing. You can control your bundled shit all you want, it will still never go up. Price needs more eyes every single day and larger and larger buy pressure flowing in.

Give the guy full credit. He is not a normal dev, he is a super dev.

Keep up the great work, brother. You are built different.
